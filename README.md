# Overview
JobMate is an AI-powered career buddy built to tackle youth unemployment in Africa. By combining CV analysis, job matching, and interview prep into one platform, JobMate helps young Africans bridge skill gaps and connect to global opportunities.

It’s available as both a web app (Next.js) and a mobile app (Flutter).

## 🚀 Problem

Youth unemployment in Africa is at crisis levels, especially in urban areas. Existing job boards don’t:

- Personalize searches for African job seekers  
- Provide real-time CV feedback  
- Offer interview coaching tuned to local cultural/remote work contexts  
- Suggest actionable skill-building paths  

---

## 💡 Solution

JobMate uses **Gemini Flash 1.5 AI** with a **Go backend** to act as a career coach:

- 📄 Analyze CVs and suggest improvements  
- 🔍 Match jobs from global & Africa-friendly platforms  
- 🎤 Coach interviews with mock Q&A + instant feedback  
- 📈 Suggest online free and affordable courses to fill skill gaps  

All in a **chat-first experience** that works in English and Amharic.
